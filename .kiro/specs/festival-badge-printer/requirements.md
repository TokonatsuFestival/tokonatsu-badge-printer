# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a web-based badge printing system for festival registration teams. The system allows front desk staff to select badge templates, enter attendee information, and send print jobs directly to a USB-connected printer. The solution integrates with existing Adobe InDesign templates and printer presets to ensure consistent badge formatting and quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a registration team member, I want to access a web-based interface for badge printing, so that I can efficiently process attendee badges without needing specialized software knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the web application THEN the system SHALL display a clean, intuitive interface accessible through any modern web browser
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive and load within 3 seconds on the local network
3. IF the printer is not connected THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating printer connectivity issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registration team member, I want to select from available badge types, so that I can choose the appropriate template for different attendee categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the badge creation interface THEN the system SHALL display all available badge templates with visual previews
2. WHEN a user selects a badge type THEN the system SHALL load the corresponding Adobe InDesign template configuration
3. IF no badge types are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and prevent form submission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registration team member, I want to enter a unique identifier and badge name, so that I can personalize each badge for the specific attendee.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a badge type THEN the system SHALL display input fields for UID and Badge Name
2. WHEN a user enters text in the UID field THEN the system SHALL validate that the UID is unique within the current session
3. WHEN a user enters text in the Badge Name field THEN the system SHALL validate that the name is not empty and within character limits
4. IF duplicate UID is entered THEN the system SHALL display a warning message and highlight the conflicting entry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a registration team member, I want to queue badge print jobs, so that I can batch process multiple badges efficiently without blocking the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a completed badge form THEN the system SHALL add the job to a print queue
2. WHEN a badge is queued THEN the system SHALL display the job in a visible queue list with status indicators
3. WHEN the print queue has jobs THEN the system SHALL show queue length and estimated processing time
4. IF the queue reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL prevent new submissions until queue space is available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a registration team member, I want badges to print automatically using preset configurations, so that I don't need to manually configure printer settings for each job.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a badge job is processed THEN the system SHALL use the predefined printer presets for size and quality settings
2. WHEN sending to printer THEN the system SHALL apply the correct Adobe InDesign template positioning for UID and Badge Name
3. WHEN a print job completes THEN the system SHALL update the job status and remove it from the active queue
4. IF printing fails THEN the system SHALL retry the job up to 3 times before marking it as failed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a registration team member, I want to see the status of print jobs, so that I can track which badges have been completed and identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates for all queued and processing jobs
2. WHEN a job status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a job fails THEN the system SHALL display the failure reason and provide options to retry or cancel
4. IF a job is stuck in processing THEN the system SHALL provide manual intervention options after 30 seconds

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the web server to communicate with USB-connected printers, so that the application can function on the registration computer without additional hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web server starts THEN the system SHALL detect and connect to available USB printers
2. WHEN printer status changes THEN the system SHALL update the interface to reflect printer availability
3. WHEN multiple printers are connected THEN the system SHALL allow selection of the target printer
4. IF no printers are detected THEN the system SHALL display setup instructions and retry options
